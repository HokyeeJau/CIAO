This system uses gas sensors to detect and classify different odors. By accessing the data from these sensors, I can determine the type and position of odors in the house."

      "content": "Kelly beer is an all-malt lager beer released by HiteJinro on April 4, 2023, with an alcohol content of 4.5%. It is made using a double maturation process at 7\u2103 and -1.5\u2103, using 100% premium malt from Denmark. This process aims to achieve both smoothness and refreshment. The beer is characterized by a relatively rich taste, smooth finish, and strong carbonation. It is noted for its strong malt and hop aroma, with a lighter finish compared to other all-malt beers. The beer is available in various sizes, including bottles, cans, and kegs, and is priced competitively in the market. Despite being a successor to the Max beer, it has not yet received the same level of acclaim among beer enthusiasts."
